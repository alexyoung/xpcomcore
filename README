XPCOMCore
=========

A standard library like Ruby's, only for JavaScript (with XPCOM access).

Installation
============

Check out / submodule in / whatever the code to a place of your choosing. Then load it from an XPCOM component like so:

    Components.utils.import("resource://app/chrome/content/vendor/xpcomcore/bootstrapper.js");

Then, to pull XPCOMCore into your scope, do this lovely little trick:
    
    XPCOMCore({scope: this});
    
If you wish to not automatically mix in the `Kernel` module, pass another argument like so:

    XPCOMCore({scope: this, importKernel: false});
    
Then, whenever you want to make use of XPCOMCore (say, from a XUL window), do the same deal. For example:

    <script type="text/javascript">XPCOMCore({scope: this});</script>
    
Then you'll have access to methods such as load() and require() and whatever else is defined in Kernel.
